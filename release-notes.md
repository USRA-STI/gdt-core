## Version 2.0.2 (Released May 10, 2023)

This released fixed a typo in a type declaration that was causing incompatibility with Python 3.8


## Version 2.0.1 (Released Apr 13, 2023)

This released fixed minor issues that were discovered after release of 2.0.0

## Version 2.0.0 (Released Apr 12, 2023)

This is the initial release.

We started the version at 2.0.0 to indicate that this is our major API update from GBM Data Tools which is version 1.1.1

Changes from GBM Data Tools include:

- Making the library more generalized so that it can be used for other gamma-ray observatories besides GBM.
- Functions that is common to all gamma-ray observatories is released as Gamma-ray Data Tools: Core
- Functions that is specific to Fermi-GBM is released as Gamma-ray Data Tools: Fermi
- Mission Elapsed Time is stored within AstroPy Time which handles the conversion to other time systems.
- Spacecraft coordinates is now using Astropy Coordinate Frames.
- Quaternions use Numpy to vectorize operations and SciPy Rotation to translate between Quaternions and Direction Cosine Matrixes.
- Fits files now support context management and perform header verification.
