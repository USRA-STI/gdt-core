Welcome to the Gamma-ray Data Tools Core Package!
=================================================

.. figure:: images/gdt_logo_big.png

The Gamma-ray Data Tools (GDT) is centralized toolkit for hard X-ray and 
gamma-ray astrophysics data analysis, with a focus on providing a uniform 
interface to the data provided by several different missions and instruments.

The GDT Core Package (``gdt-core``) contains the core components of the GDT that
can be utilized for various instruments and is a generalized version of the
`Fermi GBM Data Tools <https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/gbm/gbm_data_tools/gdt-docs>`_.
Individual mission or instrument packages can be developed using the ``gdt-core`` 
and released under the ``gdt`` namespace (see ``gdt-fermi`` as an example).

The documentation linked below walks through all of sub-packages and modules
within the gdt-core, and developers should take special note of the 
"**For Developers**" sections that detail how to subclass or design plugin functions
or classes for use in new instrument packages.
