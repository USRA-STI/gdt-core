************************************************************
Simulation Generators (:mod:`~gdt.core.simulate.generators`)
************************************************************
The simulation generators are the underlying random generators used by the GDT.
The package contains generators for both background and source signals, as well 
as generators for stationary and non-stationary processes.  Normally these are
called directly but are instead used by the PHA and TTE simulators.

Stationary Generators
=====================
There are three generators provided for stationary (non-time-varying) processes:
|PoissonBackgroundGenerator|, |GaussianBackgroundGenerator|, and 
|SourceSpectrumGenerator|.  The first two, as their names suggest, are used
for generating Poisson and Gaussian background, respectively.  The final 
generator produces Poisson source spectra.

For the background generators, we must initialize them with a 
|BackgroundSpectrum| object (see |bkgd| for more information on
creating and using background objects).  As an example, we will create 
BackgroundSpectrum with three energy channels:

    >>> from gdt.core.background.primitives import BackgroundSpectrum
    >>> rates = [37.5, 57.5, 17.5]
    >>> rate_uncert = [1.896, 2.889, 0.919]
    >>> emin = [10.0, 50.0, 150.0]
    >>> emax = [50.0, 150., 300.0]
    >>> exposure = 4.0
    >>> back_spec = BackgroundSpectrum(rates, rate_uncert, emin, emax, exposure)

Now we can initialize a PoissonBackgroundGenerator:

    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import PoissonBackgroundGenerator
    >>> gen = PoissonBackgroundGenerator(back_spec)
    
Because these are generators, we can produce random deviates one at a time or 
by use of iterators. Also note that this returns a new BackgroundSpectrum object.

    >>> # generate one deviate at a time
    >>> next(gen)
    <BackgroundSpectrum: 3 bins;
     range (10.0, 300.0);
     1 contiguous segments>
     >>> next(gen).counts
     array([122., 254.,  82.])
     >>> next(gen).counts
     array([154., 248.,  67.])

    >>> # generate 5 deviates
    >>> [next(gen).counts for i in range(5)]
    [array([139., 235.,  89.]),
     array([171., 236.,  83.]),
     array([156., 226.,  71.]),
     array([131., 227.,  73.]),
     array([130., 221.,  69.])]

Because we used the Poisson random generator, the rate uncertainty in the 
BackgroundSpectrum object is ignored.  The |GaussianBackgroundGenerator| 
utilizes the rate uncertainty and is called in the same way:

    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import GaussianBackgroundGenerator
    >>> gen = GaussianBackgroundGenerator(back_spec)
    >>> [next(gen).counts for i in range(5)]
    [array([151.78208027, 249.53694044,  70.02805299]),
     array([153.97842216, 223.21366532,  70.1612712 ]),
     array([157.26219523, 216.15423056,  68.06616171]),
     array([168.84682312, 234.86801206,  72.72010014]),
     array([148.82969865, 216.75423172,  69.06155739])]
     
Note that the counts are not integers since they are deviates from a
Gaussian distribution.  This is not a problem in practice because the fractional
part of the count represents a binomial probability of rounding up to the next
integer count.

Meanwhile, the |SourceSpectrumGenerator| is different in that it requires a 
detector response, a photon model, and an exposure to be specified.  For the 
response, we will use the example constructed in |rsp|, and then we will use a 
|Band| function (see |functions| for more information on photon models).

    >>> # already have defined the response (rsp)
    >>> from gdt.core.spectra.functions import Band
    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import SourceSpectrumGenerator
    >>> exposure = 0.256 # seconds
    >>> band_params = (0.01, 300.0, -1.0, -2.8)
    >>> gen = SourceSpectrumGenerator(rsp, Band(), band_params, exposure)

Now that our generator is initialized, we can generate deviates as we did above.
What is returned from this generator is an |EnergyBins| object containing the
source count spectrum.

    >>> next(gen)
    <EnergyBins: 4 bins;
     range (4.6, 2000.0);
     1 contiguous segments>

    >>> [next(gen).counts for i in range(5)]
    [array([21, 45, 24,  2]),
     array([26, 29, 12,  0]),
     array([32, 39, 29,  0]),
     array([21, 36, 18,  0]),
     array([28, 40, 20,  0])]


Non-stationary Generators
=========================
There are three generators provided for non-stationary (time-varying) processes:
|VariablePoissonBackground|, |VariableGaussianBackground|, and 
|VariableSourceSpectrumGenerator|. Each of these are simply time-varying 
versions of the generators described in the previous section with the same 
inputs and outputs.  The primary difference for these generators is that they
have an additional ``amp`` property that controls the overall amplitude of the 
spectrum.

As an example, let us consider the VariablePoissonBackground.  Using the same
BackgroundSpectrum as we used above, we have:

    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import VariablePoissonBackground
    >>> gen = VariablePoissonBackground(back_spec)
    >>> gen.amp
    1.0

The spectrum amplitude starts out at 1.0, which indicates no modification to
``back_spec`` that we initialized the generator with.  If we want to scale the
amplitude down, we choose a factor between 0 and 1, and if we want to scale the
amplitude up, we choose a factor greater than 1.

    >>> next(gen).counts
    array([158., 242.,  52.])
    
    >>> # scale down by half
    >>> gen.amp = 0.5
    >>> next(gen)
    array([ 74., 109.,  31.])
    
    >>> # scale up by double
    >>> gen.amp = 2.0
    >>> next(gen)
    array([308., 461., 137.])

This is often useful when needing to generate a smoothly varying background.
For example, here is a monotonically increasing background:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import VariableGaussianBackground
    >>> gen = VariableGaussianBackground(back_spec)
    >>> amps = np.linspace(1.0, 2.0, 5)
    >>> for i in range(5):
    >>>     gen.amp = amps[i]
    >>>     print(next(gen).counts)
    [145.31379504 232.99347649  73.48606776]
    [203.44744579 278.8084182   94.01676146]
    [230.21400035 381.17235449 108.87338199]
    [275.70872059 434.92589422 126.09284401]
    [322.47071056 448.91324843 139.84965114]


And finally, we can do the same thing with a source spectrum:

    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import VariableSourceSpectrumGenerator
    >>> gen = VariableSourceSpectrumGenerator(rsp, Band(), band_params, exposure)
    >>> gen.amp
    0.01
    
The one difference here is that the amplitude is defined by the amplitude of
the photon spectrum, therefore changing the amplitude value represents an 
absolute change in the count spectrum amplitude rather than a relative change
to the input spectrum as is the case for the background generators above.

    >>> next(gen)
    array([14, 36, 27,  1])
    
    >>> # scale down by half
    >>> gen.amp = 0.005
    >>> next(gen).counts
    array([17, 19, 12,  1])
    
    >>> # scale up by double
    >>> gen.amp = 0.02
    >>> next(gen).counts
    array([46, 64, 42,  2])


Event Generator
===============
All generators previously discussed produce a time-integrated count spectrum.
We can use the results from those generators to generate Poisson events sampling
from that spectrum.  To do that, we use the |EventSpectrumGenerator|, which
requires the count spectrum as an array and the duration over which the events
should be generated.  In general, we often want to generate events from a 
time-varying process, therefore the duration should be short, smaller than the 
variability timescale of the process we're simulating.

    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import EventSpectrumGenerator
    >>> count_spec = np.array([17, 19, 12,  1])
    >>> # duration of 1 microsecond
    >>> gen = EventSpectrumGenerator(count_spec, 1e-6)
    
Now, when we generate a deviate, the generator returns two outputs: the 
timestamps of the events (relative to 0) and the corresponding channels each 
event belongs to.

    >>> times, channels = next(gen)
    >>> times
    array([7.04931280e-09, 1.95609958e-08, 3.59259447e-08, 4.63927331e-08,
           7.44675927e-08, 9.32735289e-08, 1.30097727e-07, 1.30540715e-07,
           1.48487012e-07, 1.58971982e-07, 1.62517121e-07, 1.64038449e-07,
           3.31662103e-07, 3.60521335e-07, 3.61831687e-07, 3.71657726e-07,
           3.90096235e-07, 3.91158180e-07, 3.99279785e-07, 4.07058457e-07,
           4.22051030e-07, 4.33105495e-07, 4.49874647e-07, 5.27509018e-07,
           5.40521076e-07, 5.59684862e-07, 5.64229258e-07, 5.74299389e-07,
           5.98839363e-07, 6.44593252e-07, 6.46253463e-07, 6.55519637e-07,
           7.27613170e-07, 7.66563826e-07, 7.67683109e-07, 7.84325180e-07,
           7.92095865e-07, 8.15014920e-07, 8.55683135e-07, 8.56894618e-07,
           8.93823877e-07, 8.95595230e-07, 9.03290378e-07, 9.04434867e-07,
           9.16922477e-07, 9.23269820e-07, 9.45459400e-07, 9.80845020e-07,
           9.89771487e-07])
    >>> channels
    array([0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2,
           2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2,
           1, 0, 1, 0, 2])


We can update the spectrum to generate a new set of events for the next time
slice:

    >>> gen.spectrum
    array([17, 19, 12,  1])
    >>> gen.spectrum = np.array([46, 64, 42,  2])

And finally, we can specify a deadtime to apply when generating the events.
By default, the ``min_sep=0``, defining the minimum time separation allowed 
between events, but we can specify it on initialization:

    >>> # minimum time separation between events of 2e-6.
    >>> gen = EventSpectrumGenerator(count_spec, 1e-4, min_sep=2e-6)
    >>> times, channels = next(gen)
    >>> times
    array([1.07596951e-07, 4.82135218e-06, 7.70724445e-06, 1.16266006e-05,
           1.74090487e-05, 2.00668988e-05, 2.83057705e-05, 3.36177889e-05,
           3.63672699e-05, 4.10932105e-05, 4.86272788e-05, 5.38226862e-05,
           5.83086804e-05, 6.10862109e-05, 6.86386986e-05, 7.44809644e-05,
           7.87360851e-05, 8.28061508e-05, 8.68345864e-05])
    >>> channels
    array([1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0])

Setting ``min_sep > 0`` imposes a "dead time" during which events cannot be 
recorded which simulated the real deadtime experience by real detectors and 
will affect the observed count rate for relatively high rates.

Setting Generator Seeds
=======================
Users can set the seed used by each random generator object with a
``rng`` keyword when initializing the class:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=1)
    >>>
    >>> from gdt.core.simulate.generators import EventSpectrumGenerator
    >>> count_spec = np.array([17, 19, 12,  1])
    >>> gen = EventSpectrumGenerator(count_spec, 1e-6, rng=rng)

This is useful in cases where reproducibility with a known seed is desired,
such as for publicly shared simulation results.

Additionally, the random generator seed can be modified after initialization
with the |set_rng| function:

    >>> gen.set_rng(rng)

In cases where the user does not seed the generator class it
will use ``np.random.default_rng()`` to create a seed from the computer's clock time.
This will produce a different result whenever the simulation is performed at a different time.
Simulations run at the same time will produce the same result, which can be problematic for users
trying to run simulations as parallel processes. To avoid this, users should
provide unique seeds to each simulation process when running in parallel.
See :ref:`Seeding Event Data<sim-tte-seed>` and :ref:`Seeding PHA Data<sim-pha-seed>`
for parallel processing examples.
